Ghostbusters and Ghosts
A group of n Ghostbusters is battling n ghosts. Each Ghostbuster carries a proton pack, which
shoots a stream at a ghost, eradicating it. A stream goes in a straight line and terminates when it
hits the ghost. The Ghostbusters decide upon the following strategy. They will pair off with the
ghosts, forming n Ghostbuster-ghost pairs, and then simultaneously each Ghostbuster will shoot a
stream at his chosen ghost. As we all know, it is very dangerous to let streams cross, and so the
Ghostbusters must choose pairings for which no streams will cross.
